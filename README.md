# Nix configuration

This repo houses the [Home Manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager) configuration that I use for my macOS laptop. Here are some tools that I install and configure this way:

* Neovim
* tmux
* Git
* zsh and oh my zsh (including aliases and environment variables)
* curl
* Elixir (`mix`, `elixir`, `elixirc`, etc.)
* HTTPie
* jq
* Go
* fzf
* htop
* youtube-dl
* fd
* bat
* exa
* ripgrep
* tokei
* tree
* xsv
* Dhall

This list will surely grow over time as new packages are installed.
