# Nix configuration

This repo houses [Home Manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager) configuration that I use for my macOS laptop. Here is some tools that I install and configure this way:

* Neovim
* tmux
* Git
* zsh and oh my zsh (including aliases and environment variables)
* curl
* Elixir (`mix`, `elixir`, `elixirc`, etc.)
* HTTPie
* jq
* Go

This list will surely grow over time as new packages are installed.
